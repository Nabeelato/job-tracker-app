# üéØ WHAT TO DO NEXT

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Database Setup Required

Before you can use the application, you MUST set up the database. Follow these steps:

---

## üìã Step-by-Step Setup (5 minutes)

### 1. Install PostgreSQL (if not already installed)
   - Download from: https://www.postgresql.org/download/
   - Install and remember your password

### 2. Create the Database
   Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   psql -U postgres
   ```
   Then in the PostgreSQL prompt:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE job_tracking_db;
   \q
   ```

   **OR** use pgAdmin (GUI) to create a database named `job_tracking_db`

### 3. Update Your .env File
   Open `.env` and update this line:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:YOUR_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/job_tracking_db?schema=public"
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_PASSWORD` with your PostgreSQL password.

### 4. Run Database Migrations
   In your terminal (in the project folder):
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   ```
   This creates all the tables in your database.

### 5. Seed the Database (RECOMMENDED)
   ```bash
   npm run db:seed
   ```
   This adds demo data including:
   - 5 users (Admin, Manager, Supervisor, 2 Staff)
   - 3 departments
   - 4 sample jobs
   - Comments and notifications

### 6. Test the Application
   1. Open http://localhost:3000
   2. Click "Sign In"
   3. Use these credentials:
      - **Admin**: admin@example.com / admin123
      - **Manager**: manager@example.com / manager123
      - **Staff**: staff@example.com / staff123

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

Before proceeding, verify:

- [ ] PostgreSQL is installed and running
- [ ] Database `job_tracking_db` is created
- [ ] `.env` file has correct DATABASE_URL
- [ ] Migrations completed successfully (`npx prisma migrate dev --name init`)
- [ ] Seed script ran successfully (`npm run db:seed`)
- [ ] Development server is running (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] You can log in at http://localhost:3000/auth/login

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Connection refused" or "ECONNREFUSED"
**Solution**: PostgreSQL is not running. Start it:
- Windows: Check Services (PostgreSQL service should be running)
- Mac: `brew services start postgresql`
- Linux: `sudo systemctl start postgresql`

### Problem: "Authentication failed"
**Solution**: Check your password in `.env` is correct

### Problem: "Database does not exist"
**Solution**: Create it using step 2 above

### Problem: "Prisma Client not found"
**Solution**: Run `npx prisma generate`

## üé® What's Built So Far

‚úÖ **Complete Authentication System**
- Login page with validation
- Registration page
- Password hashing
- Session management
- Role-based access control

‚úÖ **Database Schema**
- Users with 4 roles
- Jobs with status tracking
- Comments and timeline
- Departments
- Notifications

‚úÖ **Protected Dashboard**
- Role-based welcome message
- Stats cards (ready for data)
- Middleware protection

‚úÖ **Utility Functions**
- Permission helpers

## üöÄ After Database Setup

Once database is set up and you can log in, you'll want to build:

### Phase 3: Core Job Management
1. **Job Creation Page** (`/jobs/new`)
   - Form to create new jobs
   - Assign to users
   - Set priority and due date

2. **Job Listing Page** (`/jobs`)
   - View all jobs (filtered by role)
   - Search and filters
   - Status badges
   - Quick actions

3. **Job Detail Page** (`/jobs/[id]`)
   - Full job information
   - Timeline of changes
   - Comments section
   - Status updates
   - Edit/delete actions

4. **Dashboard Enhancement**
   - Real job statistics
   - Recent activity feed
   - Quick actions
   - Charts and graphs

## üí° Quick Commands

```bash
# Database
npx prisma migrate dev       # Run migrations
npx prisma studio            # Open database GUI (port 5555)
npm run db:seed              # Seed with demo data
npx prisma migrate reset     # Reset database (careful!)

# Development
npm run dev                  # Start dev server (port 3000)
npm run build                # Build for production
npm run lint                 # Check code quality

# View your data
npx prisma studio            # Visual database editor
```
