# Phase 2 Complete: Service Type Tags ‚úÖ

## Summary

Successfully implemented **Phase 2** - Service Type Tags system! Jobs can now be categorized by service types (Bookkeeping, VAT, Audit, Financial Statements), enabling better organization and cross-department workflows.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates

**New ServiceType Enum:**
```prisma
enum ServiceType {
  BOOKKEEPING
  VAT
  AUDIT
  FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS
}
```

**Enhanced Job Model:**
```prisma
model Job {
  // ... existing fields
  serviceTypes ServiceType[]  // NEW: Array of service types
  // ... rest of fields
}
```

**Migration Applied:** `20251002182614_add_service_types`

###2. TypeScript Type Definitions

**Added to `src/types/index.ts`:**
```typescript
export type ServiceType = "BOOKKEEPING" | "VAT" | "AUDIT" | "FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS"

export interface Job {
  // ... existing fields
  serviceTypes?: ServiceType[]  // NEW
  // ... rest of fields
}
```

### 3. Department Setup Fixed

**Corrected Departments Created:**
- ‚úÖ BookKeeping Department
- ‚úÖ Audit Department  
- ‚úÖ VAT/TAX Department

**Removed incorrect departments:**
- ‚ùå IT Department (deleted)
- ‚ùå HR Department (deleted)
- ‚ùå Admin Department (deleted)

## Database Migration Details

### Migration File Created
```sql
-- CreateEnum
CREATE TYPE "ServiceType" AS ENUM ('BOOKKEEPING', 'VAT', 'AUDIT', 'FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS');

-- AlterTable
ALTER TABLE "Job" ADD COLUMN "serviceTypes" "ServiceType"[];
```

### Migration Applied Successfully
- ‚úÖ ServiceType enum created
- ‚úÖ serviceTypes column added to Job table
- ‚úÖ Existing data preserved
- ‚úÖ Schema in sync

## Files Modified/Created

### Schema & Database
1. ‚úÖ `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added ServiceType enum and serviceTypes field
2. ‚úÖ `prisma/migrations/20251002182614_add_service_types/migration.sql` - Migration file
3. ‚úÖ `prisma/seed.ts` - Updated with correct departments and service types
4. ‚úÖ `prisma/fix-departments.ts` - Script to fix department names
5. ‚úÖ `prisma/add-service-types.ts` - Script to add service types to existing jobs

### TypeScript Types
1. ‚úÖ `src/types/index.ts` - Added ServiceType type and updated Job interface

## Next Steps - Phase 3: Service Type UI

Now that the database schema supports service types, the next phase will add UI components to:

### Planned UI Features:

**1. Job Creation/Edit Form**
- [ ] Service type multi-select dropdown
- [ ] Visual service type badges
- [ ] Validation (at least one service type required)

**2. Job Display**
- [ ] Service type badges in job cards
- [ ] Color-coded service type indicators
  - üìã BOOKKEEPING: Blue
  - üí∞ VAT: Green  
  - ‚úÖ AUDIT: Purple
  - üìä FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS: Orange

**3. Job Filtering**
- [ ] Filter jobs by service type
- [ ] Multi-select service type filter
- [ ] "All Service Types" option
- [ ] Filter count indicators

**4. Department-Service Analytics**
- [ ] Jobs per service type chart
- [ ] Department workload by service type
- [ ] Cross-department collaboration tracking

### Example Job with Service Types:

```typescript
{
  jobId: "JOB-001",
  clientName: "ABC Company Ltd",
  title: "Monthly Bookkeeping for ABC Company",
  serviceTypes: ["BOOKKEEPING"], // NEW
  assignedTo: {...},
  department: "BookKeeping Department",
  ...
}
```

## Benefits of Service Type System

### ‚úÖ Better Organization
- Clear categorization of work types
- Easy identification of job requirements
- Consistent service classification

### ‚úÖ Cross-Department Workflows
- Track jobs that span multiple departments
- Identify collaboration opportunities
- Clear service type assignments

### ‚úÖ Improved Reporting
- Service type performance metrics
- Department workload by service type
- Client service mix analysis

### ‚úÖ Enhanced Filtering
- Find all VAT-related jobs quickly
- Filter by multiple service types
- Department-specific service views

## Service Type Usage Guidelines

### Single Service Type Jobs
Use when job involves only one type of work:
```typescript
serviceTypes: ["BOOKKEEPING"]  // Only bookkeeping
serviceTypes: ["VAT"]          // Only VAT return
```

### Multi-Service Type Jobs
Use when job requires multiple services:
```typescript
serviceTypes: ["BOOKKEEPING", "VAT"]  // Both services needed
serviceTypes: ["AUDIT", "FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS"]  // Audit + FS
```

### Choosing Service Types
- **BOOKKEEPING**: Any transaction recording, categorization, reconciliation
- **VAT**: VAT returns, VAT compliance, VAT-specific work
- **AUDIT**: Audit preparation, audit services, audit reviews
- **FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS**: FS preparation, management accounts, financial reports

## Testing the Implementation

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. ‚úÖ Check database schema has ServiceType enum
2. ‚úÖ Verify Job table has serviceTypes column
3. ‚úÖ Confirm migration applied successfully
4. ‚úÖ Test TypeScript types compile correctly
5. ‚è≥ Add service types to job creation form (Phase 3)
6. ‚è≥ Display service types in job listings (Phase 3)
7. ‚è≥ Test filtering by service type (Phase 3)

### Database Verification:
```sql
-- Check enum exists
SELECT * FROM pg_enum WHERE enumlabel LIKE '%BOOKKEEPING%';

-- Check column exists
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'Job' AND column_name = 'serviceTypes';
```

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed (Phase 1 & 2)
- Department management system
- User-department integration
- Service type database schema
- Service type TypeScript types
- Correct 3 departments created
- Migration applied successfully

### üîÑ Ready for Phase 3
- Service type UI components
- Job creation/edit with service types
- Service type display and filtering
- Department-service analytics

## Quick Reference

### Service Type Colors (for UI)
```typescript
const SERVICE_TYPE_COLORS = {
  BOOKKEEPING: 'bg-blue-100 text-blue-800 dark:bg-blue-900/30 dark:text-blue-300',
  VAT: 'bg-green-100 text-green-800 dark:bg-green-900/30 dark:text-green-300',
  AUDIT: 'bg-purple-100 text-purple-800 dark:bg-purple-900/30 dark:text-purple-300',
  FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS: 'bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900/30 dark:text-orange-300',
};
```

### Service Type Labels
```typescript
const SERVICE_TYPE_LABELS = {
  BOOKKEEPING: 'Bookkeeping',
  VAT: 'VAT',
  AUDIT: 'Audit',
  FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS: 'Financial Statements',
};
```

### Service Type Icons
```typescript
import { Calculator, FileText, CheckCircle, FileSpreadsheet } from 'lucide-react';

const SERVICE_TYPE_ICONS = {
  BOOKKEEPING: Calculator,
  VAT: FileText,
  AUDIT: CheckCircle,
  FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS: FileSpreadsheet,
};
```
