# 🚀 Deployment Status - October 8, 2025

## ✅ **DEPLOYED TO VERCEL**

### **Latest Changes Pushed:**

#### **1. Landing Page Redirect Fix** ✅
- **File:** `src/app/page.tsx`
- **Commit:** `a9faf87`
- **Change:** Authenticated users are now automatically redirected to `/dashboard`
- **Status:** ✅ Pushed to GitHub
- **Deployment:** ⏳ Vercel is auto-deploying (2-3 minutes)

---

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed:**

### **Issue:**
- Logged-in users visiting the root URL (`/`) saw the landing page with "Get Started" and "Sign Up" buttons
- Confusing UX - users were already logged in but app showed them the marketing page

### **Solution:**
- Added server-side authentication check using `getServerSession`
- Authenticated users are now automatically redirected to `/dashboard`
- Landing page only shows to non-authenticated visitors

### **Code Changes:**
```typescript
export default async function Home() {
  // Check if user is authenticated
  const session = await getServerSession(authOptions);
  
  // If logged in, redirect to dashboard
  if (session) {
    redirect("/dashboard");
  }

  // Show landing page only for guests
  return (
    // ... landing page content
  )
}
```
