## Part 2: Credit/Statistics System

### Database Schema
No schema changes needed - statistics calculated dynamically from existing job relationships.

### API Endpoint
**File:** `src/app/api/users/[id]/stats/route.ts` (NEW)
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/users/[id]/stats`

**Returns:**
```json

## Technical Implementation

### Statistics Calculation
```typescript
// Completed as Staff
const assignedJobs = await prisma.job.findMany({
  where: { assignedToId: userId }
});
completedAsStaff = assignedJobs.filter(j => j.status === "COMPLETED").length;

// Completion Rate
completionRate = (completedAsStaff / totalJobsAssigned) * 100;

// Active Jobs
activeJobs = assignedJobs.filter(
  j => j.status !== "COMPLETED" && j.status !== "CANCELLED"
).length;
```

### Performance Considerations
- ✅ Single API call fetches all stats
- ✅ Database indexes on assignedToId, managerId, supervisorId
- ✅ Client-side caching (useEffect)
- ✅ Loading states for UX
- ✅ Error handling

### Dark Mode Support
