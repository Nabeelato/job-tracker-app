# Job Workflow Features - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Changes

### 1. **Job Assignment Workflow**
- **Manager/Admin creates job** ‚Üí Assigns to **Supervisor** (required)
- **Supervisor receives job** ‚Üí Assigns to **Staff member**
- **Staff member** sees only jobs assigned to them

#### Changes Made:
- **Job Creation Form** (`src/app/jobs/new/page.tsx`)
  - Removed "Assign To (Staff)" field
  - Made Supervisor assignment required
  - Added helper text: "Supervisor will assign this job to a staff member"
  - Initially assigns job to the supervisor (assignedToId = supervisorId)

- **Job Creation API** (`src/app/api/jobs/route.ts`)
  - Updated validation to require supervisorId
  - Removes assignedToId from required fields during creation
  - Initially sets assignedToId = supervisorId
  - Creates notification for supervisor about new assignment
  - Verifies supervisor has SUPERVISOR role

### 2. **Role-Based Job Visibility**
Updated API filtering in `src/app/api/jobs/route.ts`:
- **STAFF**: See only jobs where `assignedToId = user.id`
- **SUPERVISOR**: See only jobs where `supervisorId = user.id`
- **MANAGER/ADMIN**: See all jobs (no filter)

### 3. **Staff Assignment by Supervisor**
Created new API endpoint: `src/app/api/jobs/[id]/assign/route.ts`

**Features:**
- Allows supervisor or manager/admin to assign staff to a job
- Validates staff member has STAFF role
- Creates timeline entry for the assignment
- Updates job's assignedToId field
- Permission check: Only the assigned supervisor or manager/admin can assign

**Usage:**
```typescript
POST /api/jobs/{jobId}/assign
Body: { staffId: "user_id_here" }
```

### 4. **Completion Request Feature**
Created new API endpoint: `src/app/api/jobs/[id]/request-completion/route.ts`

**Features:**
- Staff can request completion from supervisor/manager
- Changes job status to `AWAITING_APPROVAL`
- Creates timeline entry for the request
- Optionally includes a message from staff
- Creates comment with the request message

**Usage:**
```typescript
POST /api/jobs/{jobId}/request-completion
Body: { message: "Optional completion message" }
```

### 5. **Timeline System**
Created new API endpoint: `src/app/api/jobs/[id]/timeline/route.ts`

**Features:**
- Returns all StatusUpdate entries for a job
- Ordered chronologically (oldest first)

- `STAFF_ASSIGNED` - When supervisor assigns staff
- `COMMENT_ADDED` - When anyone adds a comment
- `COMPLETION_REQUESTED` - When staff requests completion
- `STATUS_CHANGED` - When job status changes

### 6. **Comments Auto-Update Timeline**
Updated `src/app/api/jobs/[id]/comments/route.ts`:
- Automatically creates a timeline entry when comment is added
- Stores first 100 characters of comment as preview
- Notifies all related users (manager, supervisor, staff, creator)

### 7. **Accordion Jobs List**
Created new jobs page: `src/app/jobs/page-accordion.tsx`

**Features:**

- Real-time timeline loading
- Compact view showing:
  - Job ID
