# Timeline Error Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')
**Error Location:** Timeline display when expanding a job

**Root Cause:** 
- The timeline API endpoint returned `User` (capitalized) as the relation name from Prisma
- The frontend code expected `user` (lowercase) with a `name` property
- When mapping over timeline events, `event.user.name` was undefined

**Solution:**
- Modified `/src/app/api/jobs/[id]/timeline/route.ts` to map the Prisma `User` relation to lowercase `user` for frontend compatibility
- Added transformation: `timeline.map((event) => ({ ...event, user: event.User }))`

**Files Changed:**
- `/src/app/api/jobs/[id]/timeline/route.ts`

### 2. TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')
**Error Location:** Timeline display when expanding a job

**Root Cause:**
- Some timeline events might have `null` or missing `User` relations (e.g., if a user was deleted)
- Frontend code didn't have null checks before accessing `event.user.name` or `event.id`
- This caused crashes when rendering timeline events with missing data

**Solution:**
- Added null safety checks in the API: `event.User || { id: 'unknown', name: 'Unknown User', avatar: null }`
- Added null checks in frontend components before rendering:
  - `if (!event || !event.id) return null;`
  - `const userName = event.user?.name || 'Unknown User';`
- Applied fixes to all timeline rendering locations

**Files Changed:**
- `/src/app/api/jobs/[id]/timeline/route.ts` - Fallback for null users
- `/src/app/jobs/page.tsx` - Safety checks in two timeline map functions
- `/src/components/monthly-jobs-view.tsx` - Safety checks in timeline display

### 3. 404 Error: Failed to load resource `/auth/forgot-password`
**Error Location:** Login page

**Root Cause:**
- Login page had a link to `/auth/forgot-password` route
- This route/page doesn't exist in the application

**Solution:**
- Commented out the "Forgot password?" link in the login page
- Added a comment noting the feature is not yet implemented

**Files Changed:**
- `/src/app/auth/login/page.tsx`

## Testing
After these fixes:
- ✅ Timeline should display correctly when expanding a job
- ✅ No more TypeError when viewing job timeline (even with deleted users)
- ✅ Timeline events with missing user data show "Unknown User"
- ✅ No more 404 error for forgot-password route
- ✅ Login page loads without console errors
- ✅ Robust error handling for null/undefined timeline data

## Future Enhancements
If you want to implement the forgot password feature:
1. Create `/src/app/auth/forgot-password/page.tsx`
2. Create `/src/app/api/auth/forgot-password/route.ts` 
3. Implement email sending for password reset
4. Uncomment the link in the login page

## Deployment
All fixes have been committed and pushed to GitHub:
- Commit: 5658094 - Timeline User mapping fix
- Commit: 9869f3e - Forgot password link removal
- Commit: aa73475 - Null safety checks for timeline events

Vercel will automatically deploy these changes.
