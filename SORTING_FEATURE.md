# Sorting Feature Documentation

## Overview
Comprehensive sorting functionality has been added to the Jobs page using **clickable column headers with visual arrow indicators**, providing an intuitive and industry-standard user experience similar to spreadsheet applications and modern data tables.

## Features

### Sort Fields Available
The following columns support sorting by clicking their headers in the table view:

1. **Job ID** - Alphabetical sorting of job IDs
2. **Client Name** - Alphabetical sorting by client name
3. **Job Title** - Alphabetical sorting by job title
4. **Priority** - Smart sorting: URGENT → HIGH → NORMAL → LOW
5. **Status** - Alphabetical sorting by status
6. **Manager** - Alphabetical by manager name
7. **Supervisor** - Alphabetical by supervisor name
8. **Staff** - Alphabetical by assigned staff member (unassigned jobs appear last)
9. **Started** (Created Date) - Chronological sorting by creation date
10. **Due Date** - Chronological sorting (jobs without due dates appear last)

### Sort Orders
- **Ascending (A-Z, 0-9, Old-New)**
  - Text: A to Z
  - Numbers: 0 to 9, smallest to largest
  - Dates: Oldest to newest
  - Priority: URGENT first, LOW last

- **Descending (Z-A, 9-0, New-Old)**
  - Text: Z to A
  - Numbers: 9 to 0, largest to smallest
  - Dates: Newest to oldest
  - Priority: LOW first, URGENT last

## User Interface

### Clickable Column Headers
In the **Table View**, sortable column headers are clickable and display visual sort indicators:

- **⇅ (Double Arrow - Faded/Gray)**: Column is not currently being sorted
  - Click to sort by this column in ascending order
  
- **↑ (Up Arrow - Active)**: Column is currently sorted in **ascending order**
  - Click again to toggle to descending order
  
- **↓ (Down Arrow - Active)**: Column is currently sorted in **descending order**
  - Click again to toggle back to ascending order

### Interactive Behavior
1. **Click any sortable column header** to sort by that field
2. **First click**: Sorts in ascending order, shows ↑ arrow
3. **Second click**: Toggles to descending order, shows ↓ arrow
4. **Third click**: Toggles back to ascending order, shows ↑ arrow (cycle continues)
5. **Hover effect**: Sortable column headers have a hover background color to indicate they are interactive
6. **Cursor**: Sortable headers show a pointer cursor to indicate clickability

### Visual Design
- Sortable headers use a light gray background on hover for visual feedback
- Arrow icons are sized at 12x12px (w-3 h-3 in Tailwind) for subtle, clean appearance
- Active sort arrows are fully opaque while inactive double-arrows are 30% opacity
- Column headers display flex layout with gap between text and icon

### Non-Sortable Columns
The following columns are **not sortable** (no arrow indicators or click behavior):
- **Checkbox column** (for bulk selection)
- **Service column** (displays service type badges)
- **Comments column** (shows comment count icon)
- **Actions column** (displays action buttons)

## Default Behavior
- **Default Sort Field**: `createdAt` (Started column)
- **Default Sort Order**: Descending (newest jobs appear first at the top of the list)
- This default behavior ensures users see the most recently created jobs immediately upon loading the page

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
The sorting feature uses React `useState` hooks to manage:
- `sortBy`: Current field being sorted (e.g., "jobId", "clientName", "dueDate")
- `sortOrder`: Current order, either "asc" (ascending) or "desc" (descending)

### Sort Handler
The `handleSort(field)` function:
1. Checks if the clicked field is already the active sort field
2. If yes: toggles between "asc" and "desc"
3. If no: sets the new field as active and resets to "asc"

### How It Works
1. Jobs are first **filtered** based on search term and filter criteria
2. Filtered jobs are then **sorted** according to the selected field and order using the `getSortedJobs()` function
3. Sorted results are displayed in the current view mode (table, grid, or monthly)

### Null Value Handling
The sorting logic gracefully handles missing or null values:
- Jobs **without a due date** are sorted to the end when sorting by due date
- **Unassigned jobs** (no staff) appear at the end when sorting by staff
- Jobs **without manager/supervisor** are sorted to the end for those fields
- This ensures incomplete data doesn't break the sort or appear randomly

### Priority Sorting Logic
Priority has a smart sort order that respects urgency levels:
```javascript
const priorityOrder = { URGENT: 0, HIGH: 1, NORMAL: 2, LOW: 3 };
```
- **Ascending**: URGENT (0) → HIGH (1) → NORMAL (2) → LOW (3)
- **Descending**: LOW (3) → NORMAL (2) → HIGH (1) → URGENT (0)

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Find Most Urgent Jobs
1. **Click** the "Priority" column header
2. **First click**: Ascending order (URGENT jobs appear first)
3. Result: Jobs sorted by urgency level

### Example 2: Find Newest Jobs
1. **Click** the "Started" column header
2. **Second click**: Descending order (newest first)
3. Result: Most recently created jobs appear first (this is also the default)

### Example 3: Find Jobs Due Soon
1. **Click** the "Due Date" column header
2. **First click**: Ascending order (earliest due dates first)
3. Result: Jobs with upcoming due dates appear at the top

### Example 4: Alphabetical Client List
1. **Click** the "Client" column header
2. **First click**: Ascending order (A to Z)
3. Result: Clients sorted alphabetically

### Example 5: View by Job Number
1. **Click** the "Job ID" column header
2. **First click**: Ascending order (lowest to highest job numbers)
3. Result: Jobs sorted by ID in sequential order

## Compatibility
- ✅ Works with all filter combinations
- ✅ Works with search functionality
- ✅ Applies to all view modes (Table, Grid, Monthly)
- ✅ Persists when switching between view modes
- ✅ Compatible with bulk selection

## Performance
- **Client-side sorting**: All sorting is performed in the browser after data is fetched
- **Efficient for typical datasets**: Optimized for hundreds of jobs without performance degradation
- **Native JavaScript sort**: Uses native `Array.sort()` with custom comparison functions
- **Real-time updates**: Sorting responds instantly to user clicks with no server round-trip
- **No pagination required**: Handles the typical job list size efficiently without needing pagination

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements for future versions:
- **Persistent sort preferences**: Save user's preferred sort field and order in localStorage or user preferences
- **Multi-level sorting**: Sort by multiple criteria (e.g., sort by priority first, then by due date as a secondary sort)
- **Sort presets**: Quick access buttons for common sort combinations
- **Keyboard navigation**: Support arrow keys and Enter to navigate and activate column sorts
- **Sort persistence across sessions**: Remember sort state when user navigates away and returns

## Accessibility
- Column headers use semantic HTML with proper ARIA attributes
- Keyboard navigation is supported (click handlers work with Enter key)
- Visual indicators (arrows) are supplemented by hover states for better usability
- High contrast between active and inactive sort indicators

## Commit History
**Latest Update**: Clickable column header sorting implementation
**Previous Version**: Dropdown-based sorting (deprecated)
**Migration**: All sorting dropdowns removed from filter section, replaced with intuitive column header clicks
