# Sorting Feature Documentation

## Overview
Comprehensive sorting functionality has been added to the Jobs page, allowing users to sort jobs by multiple criteria in ascending or descending order.

## Features

### Sort Fields Available
1. **Job ID** - Alphabetical sorting of job IDs
2. **Client Name** - Alphabetical sorting by client name
3. **Job Title** - Alphabetical sorting by job title
4. **Priority** - Smart sorting: URGENT → HIGH → NORMAL → LOW
5. **Status** - Alphabetical sorting by status
6. **Due Date** - Chronological sorting (jobs without due dates appear last)
7. **Created Date** - Chronological sorting by creation date
8. **Staff** - Alphabetical by assigned staff member (unassigned jobs appear last)
9. **Manager** - Alphabetical by manager name
10. **Supervisor** - Alphabetical by supervisor name

### Sort Orders
- **Ascending (A-Z, 0-9, Old-New)**
  - Text: A to Z
  - Numbers: 0 to 9, smallest to largest
  - Dates: Oldest to newest
  - Priority: URGENT first, LOW last

- **Descending (Z-A, 9-0, New-Old)**
  - Text: Z to A
  - Numbers: 9 to 0, largest to smallest
  - Dates: Newest to oldest
  - Priority: LOW first, URGENT last

## Location
The sorting controls are located in the **Filters & Search** section:
- **Sort By** dropdown - Select which field to sort by
- **Order** dropdown - Choose ascending or descending order

## Default Behavior
- **Default Sort Field**: Created Date
- **Default Sort Order**: Descending (newest jobs first)

## Technical Implementation

### How It Works
1. Jobs are first **filtered** based on search term and filter criteria
2. Filtered jobs are then **sorted** according to the selected field and order
3. Sorted results are displayed in the current view mode (table, grid, or monthly)

### Null Value Handling
- Jobs without a due date are sorted to the end when sorting by due date
- Unassigned jobs appear at the end when sorting by staff
- Jobs without manager/supervisor are sorted to the end for those fields

### Priority Sorting Logic
Priority has a smart sort order that respects urgency levels:
```javascript
URGENT = 0 (highest priority)
HIGH = 1
NORMAL = 2
LOW = 3 (lowest priority)
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Find Most Urgent Jobs
1. Set **Sort By**: Priority
2. Set **Order**: Ascending
3. Result: URGENT jobs appear first

### Example 2: Find Newest Jobs
1. Set **Sort By**: Created Date
2. Set **Order**: Descending
3. Result: Most recently created jobs appear first

### Example 3: Find Jobs Due Soon
1. Set **Sort By**: Due Date
2. Set **Order**: Ascending
3. Result: Jobs with earliest due dates appear first

### Example 4: Alphabetical Client List
1. Set **Sort By**: Client Name
2. Set **Order**: Ascending
3. Result: Clients sorted A to Z

## Compatibility
- ✅ Works with all filter combinations
- ✅ Works with search functionality
- ✅ Applies to all view modes (Table, Grid, Monthly)
- ✅ Persists when switching between view modes
- ✅ Compatible with bulk selection

## Performance
- Sorting is performed client-side after filtering
- Efficient for typical job lists (hundreds of jobs)
- Uses native JavaScript sort with optimized comparison functions

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements for future versions:
- Save user's preferred sort settings
- Multi-level sorting (e.g., sort by priority, then by due date)
- Visual indicators on table headers showing current sort field
- Quick sort buttons in table headers (click to sort)
