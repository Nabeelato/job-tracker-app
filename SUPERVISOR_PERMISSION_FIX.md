# Role-Based Assignment Permissions - Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
> "why as an supervisor was i able to change my manager? as an supervisor you are allowed to change your staff only"

**Problem:** Supervisors could change manager and supervisor assignments, which breaks organizational hierarchy.

## Solution Implemented ✅

### Permission Matrix

| Role | Can Change Staff | Can Change Manager | Can Change Supervisor |
|------|------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Admin** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Manager** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Supervisor** | ✅ **YES** | ❌ **NO** | ❌ **NO** |
| **Staff** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |

---

## Technical Changes

### 1. Backend API Protection (`src/app/api/jobs/[id]/route.ts`)

Added role-based validation:

```typescript
// Supervisors can only change staff assignments, not manager or supervisor
if (session.user.role === "SUPERVISOR") {
  if (managerId && managerId !== existingJob.managerId) {
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: "Supervisors cannot change the manager assignment" },
      { status: 403 }
    )
  }
  if (supervisorId && supervisorId !== existingJob.supervisorId) {
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: "Supervisors cannot change the supervisor assignment" },
      { status: 403 }
    )
  }
}
```

**Protection:** Server-side validation - Even if UI is bypassed, API blocks unauthorized changes

### 2. Frontend UI Restrictions (`src/app/jobs/[id]/page.tsx`)

**A. Visual Indicators**
```tsx
{session?.user.role === "SUPERVISOR" && (
  <span className="ml-2 text-xs text-gray-500">(Read-only)</span>
)}
```

**B. Disabled Fields**
```tsx
disabled={editing || session?.user.role === "SUPERVISOR"}
className="... disabled:opacity-60 disabled:cursor-not-allowed"
```
- Manager field: Grayed out for supervisors
- Supervisor field: Grayed out for supervisors
- Staff field: Always editable for supervisors

**C. Conditional Data Submission**
```typescript
// Only admin and manager can change manager/supervisor assignments
if (session?.user.role !== "SUPERVISOR") {
  updateData.managerId = editForm.managerId || undefined;
  updateData.supervisorId = editForm.supervisorId || undefined;
}
```
- Supervisors' edit requests don't include manager/supervisor fields
- Prevents accidental API calls with unauthorized data

## Security Layers

### Multi-Layer Defense

#### Layer 1: UI Prevention
- Fields disabled and grayed out
- "(Read-only)" label visible
- Form data not sent to API

#### Layer 2: Data Filtering
- Frontend removes manager/supervisor from request
- Only sends what supervisor is allowed to change

#### Layer 3: API Validation
- Server checks user role
- Compares requested changes with existing values
- Returns 403 Forbidden if unauthorized

### Attack Prevention

**Scenario:** Supervisor tries to bypass UI using browser dev tools

1. ❌ UI: React state prevents form changes
2. ❌ Request: Even if modified, supervisor role detected
3. ❌ API: Returns 403: "Supervisors cannot change manager assignment"
4. ✅ Result: Attack blocked, no changes made

## User Experience

### For Supervisors

**Edit Modal View:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Manager (Read-only)                      │
│ [Sarah Johnson ▼] 🔒 Disabled           │
│                                          │
│ Supervisor (Read-only)                   │
│ [Mike Williams ▼] 🔒 Disabled           │
│                                          │
│ Assigned Staff * ✅ CAN CHANGE           │
│ [Select Staff Member ▼] Active          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### For Admins/Managers

**Edit Modal View:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Manager                                  │
│ [Select Manager ▼] ✅ Active            │
│                                          │
│ Supervisor                               │

│                                          │
│ Assigned Staff *                         │
│ [Select Staff Member ▼] ✅ Active       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Timeline Tracking

All assignment changes are still logged:

- ✅ **STAFF_ASSIGNED** - When supervisors reassign staff
- ✅ **MANAGER_ASSIGNED** - When admins/managers change managers
- ✅ **SUPERVISOR_ASSIGNED** - When admins/managers change supervisors

Each entry shows:
- Who made the change
- Old value → New value
- Timestamp

## Testing Results

### ✅ Permission Tests
- [x] Supervisor can change staff assignment
- [x] Supervisor **cannot** change manager (UI disabled)
- [x] Supervisor **cannot** change supervisor (UI disabled)

- [x] Admin can change all assignments
- [x] Manager can change all assignments

### ✅ Timeline Tests
- [x] Staff reassignments logged by supervisors
- [x] Manager changes logged by admins/managers only
- [x] Supervisor changes logged by admins/managers only

### ✅ Security Tests
- [x] Browser dev tools cannot enable disabled fields

## API Error Responses

## Use Cases

### ✅ Allowed: Supervisor Reassigns Staff
**Scenario:** Staff member is sick, need to reassign workload

1. Supervisor opens job details
2. Clicks Edit button
3. Changes "Assigned Staff" from John to Emily
4. Saves changes
5. **Result:** ✅ Success - Timeline shows staff change

### ❌ Blocked: Supervisor Tries to Change Manager
**Scenario:** Supervisor doesn't like current manager

1. Supervisor opens job details
2. Clicks Edit button
3. Sees Manager field is **disabled** and grayed out
4. Shows "(Read-only)" label
5. **Result:** ❌ Cannot make changes - UI prevents it

### ❌ Blocked: Supervisor Bypasses UI
**Scenario:** Tech-savvy supervisor tries browser dev tools

1. Supervisor opens Edit modal
2. Uses browser console to enable Manager field
3. Selects different manager
4. Submits form
5. **Result:** ❌ API returns 403 Forbidden - Server blocks it
