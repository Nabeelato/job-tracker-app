## Feature Summary

### What Was Built
A comprehensive employee daily task tracking system with:

1. **Task Management**
   - Create, view, update, and delete tasks
   - Three status states: PENDING â†’ IN_PROGRESS â†’ COMPLETED
   - Task descriptions and client assignment

2. **Automatic Time Tracking**
   - Start time recorded when task begins
   - End time recorded when task completes
   - Automatic calculation: `(completedAt - startedAt) / 60000`
   - Human-readable display: "2h 15m"

3. **Client Assignment**
   - Optional client field on tasks
   - Filter tasks by client
   - Client-based analytics

4. **Role-Based Permissions**
   - All users: Create and manage own tasks
   - ADMIN/MANAGER: View all tasks, delete any task
   - STAFF: View only own tasks (unless viewing history)

5. **Statistics Dashboard**
   - Real-time metrics (today, pending, active, completed)
   - Completion rate calculation
   - Total time spent tracking
   - Average time per task
   - Tasks grouped by client

6. **User History**
   - Click any username to view their task history
   - See all tasks with time tracking data

### Database Schema
```prisma
model Task {
  id               String     @id
  title            String
  description      String?
  clientName       String?
  status           TaskStatus @default(PENDING)
  userId           String
  startedAt        DateTime?
  completedAt      DateTime?
  timeSpentMinutes Int?
  createdAt        DateTime   @default(now())
  updatedAt        DateTime
  User             User       @relation("UserTasks")
}

enum TaskStatus {
  PENDING
  IN_PROGRESS
  COMPLETED
}
```

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/tasks` - List tasks with filters
- `POST /api/tasks` - Create new task
- `PATCH /api/tasks/[id]` - Update task (with automatic time tracking)
- `DELETE /api/tasks/[id]` - Delete task (admin/manager only)
- `GET /api/tasks/stats` - Get statistics and analytics

### Files Created
1. `/src/app/api/tasks/route.ts` (156 lines)
2. `/src/app/api/tasks/[id]/route.ts` (156 lines)
3. `/src/app/api/tasks/stats/route.ts` (116 lines)
4. `/src/app/tasks/page.tsx` (600+ lines)
5. `/DAILY_TASKS_FEATURE.md` (Complete documentation)
6. `/DAILY_TASKS_COMPLETE.md` (Implementation summary)

### Files Modified
1. `/prisma/schema.prisma` - Added Task model
2. `/src/components/navbar.tsx` - Added Tasks link

## How to Use

### For Employees (All Roles)
1. Click "Tasks" in the navigation bar
2. Click "Add Task" to create a new task
3. Fill in title, client (optional), and description (optional)
4. Click "Start" when you begin working (records start time)
5. Click "Complete" when finished (calculates time automatically)
6. View your statistics in the dashboard cards

### For Managers/Admins
1. Navigate to Tasks page
2. Use "Show All" to see all employees' tasks
3. Filter by specific user to see their tasks
4. Filter by client to see client-specific work
5. Review statistics for team productivity
6. Delete tasks if needed

### Example Workflow
```
Employee: "Faizan Ali"
Task: "Punching invoices for NSA Communications"

1. Creates task â†’ Status: PENDING
2. Clicks "Start" at 09:30 AM â†’ Status: IN_PROGRESS, startedAt: 09:30
3. Works on task
4. Clicks "Complete" at 11:45 AM â†’ Status: COMPLETED, completedAt: 11:45
5. System automatically calculates: 135 minutes (2h 15m)
6. Displays: "Time spent: 2h 15m"
```

## Technical Notes

### TypeScript Prisma Type Issue
During development, we encountered a known issue where TypeScript's language server doesn't immediately recognize newly generated Prisma models. This was resolved by:

1. Running `npx prisma generate` to generate the client
2. Restarting the Next.js dev server
3. Waiting for TypeScript to refresh its type cache

The issue self-resolved after the server fully loaded the new types.

### Time Tracking Implementation
Time tracking is automatic and happens in the PATCH endpoint:

```typescript
// Starting task
if (status === "IN_PROGRESS" && task.status === "PENDING") {
  updateData.startedAt = new Date();
}

// Completing task
if (status === "COMPLETED" && task.status === "IN_PROGRESS") {
  const now = new Date();
  updateData.completedAt = now;
  
  if (task.startedAt) {
    const timeSpent = Math.round(
      (now.getTime() - task.startedAt.getTime()) / 60000
    );
    updateData.timeSpentMinutes = timeSpent;
  }
}
```

### Permission Enforcement
Permissions are enforced at two levels:

1. **Backend API**: Route handlers check user roles and ownership
2. **Frontend UI**: Action buttons are conditionally rendered based on permissions

This provides defense-in-depth security.

## Performance

### Page Load Times
- Tasks page: 117 KB First Load JS
- API routes: Serverless functions (0 B client-side)
- Database queries: Optimized with Prisma indexing

### Scalability
- Indexed fields: `userId`, `status`, `createdAt`, `clientName`
- Efficient queries with `where` clauses
- Pagination-ready (can add `take` and `skip`)
