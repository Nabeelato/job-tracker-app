# Archive Feature Implementation - Complete ✅

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive job archiving system that allows Managers and Admins to mark jobs as either **Complete** or **Cancelled**, moving them to a dedicated Archive section with full audit trail and notifications.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Permission System
**File:** `src/lib/permissions.ts`

Added two new permission functions:
- `canCompleteJob(role)`: Returns true for ADMIN, MANAGER, and SUPERVISOR
- `canCancelJob(role)`: Returns true for ADMIN and MANAGER only

```typescript
export function canCompleteJob(role: UserRole): boolean {
  return ["ADMIN", "MANAGER", "SUPERVISOR"].includes(role);
}

export function canCancelJob(role: UserRole): boolean {
  return ["ADMIN", "MANAGER"].includes(role);
}
```

### 2. Archive API Endpoint
**File:** `src/app/api/jobs/[id]/archive/route.ts` (NEW FILE)

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/jobs/[id]/archive`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "action": "complete" | "cancel",
  "reason": "Optional explanation text"
}
```

**Functionality:**
- ✅ Validates user permissions based on action
- ✅ Looks up database user by email (avoids session ID mismatch)
- ✅ Updates job status to COMPLETED or CANCELLED
- ✅ Sets `completedAt` timestamp
- ✅ Creates StatusUpdate timeline entry with JOB_COMPLETED or JOB_CANCELLED action
- ✅ Creates optional Comment if reason provided
- ✅ Sends notifications to all stakeholders:
  - Job manager
  - Job supervisor
  - Assigned staff member
  - Job creator (if different from above)
- ✅ Returns updated job object

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "job-id",
  "status": "COMPLETED",
  "completedAt": "2024-10-02T10:30:00.000Z",
  ...
}
```

### 3. Archive Viewing Page
**File:** `src/app/jobs/archive/page.tsx` (NEW FILE)

**Route:** `/jobs/archive`

**Features:**
- ✅ Three-way filter system:
  - **All**: Shows both completed and cancelled jobs
  - **Completed**: Shows only completed jobs (green badge)
  - **Cancelled**: Shows only cancelled jobs (red badge)
- ✅ Card-based grid layout (responsive: 1-3 columns)
- ✅ Each card displays:
  - Job ID and Title
  - Client name
  - Status badge (colored)
  - Completion date
  - Team members (Manager, Supervisor, Staff)
  - Link to full job details
- ✅ Empty state messages for each filter
- ✅ Visual status indicators with appropriate colors

**UI Components:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  Filter: [All] [Completed] [Cancelled]  │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐   │
│  │ Job Card │  │ Job Card │   │
│  │ ID: 001  │  │ ID: 002  │   │
│  │ Status   │  │ Status   │   │
│  └──────────┘  └──────────┘   │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 4. Job Detail Page Integration
**File:** `src/app/jobs/[id]/page.tsx` (UPDATED)

**New State Variables:**
```typescript
const [showArchiveModal, setShowArchiveModal] = useState(false);
const [archiveAction, setArchiveAction] = useState<"complete" | "cancel" | null>(null);
const [archiveReason, setArchiveReason] = useState("");
const [archiving, setArchiving] = useState(false);
```

**New Permission Checks:**
```typescript
const canComplete = session && canCompleteJob(session.user.role);
const canCancel = session && canCancelJob(session.user.role);
const isArchived = job.status === "COMPLETED" || job.status === "CANCELLED";
```

**New Action Buttons:**
Added to job header (next to Edit/Delete buttons):
- ✅ **Complete Button** (green): Visible if `canComplete && !isArchived`
- ✅ **Cancel Button** (red): Visible if `canCancel && !isArchived`
- Both buttons hidden once job is archived

**Button UI:**
```tsx
<button className="bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-700">
  <CheckCircle2 /> Complete
</button>

<button className="bg-red-600 hover:bg-red-700">
  <XCircle /> Cancel
</button>
```

**Archive Modal:**
Beautiful custom modal similar to status change modal:
- ✅ Dynamic gradient header (green for complete, red for cancel)
- ✅ Icon indicator (CheckCircle2 or XCircle)
- ✅ Job information display
- ✅ Optional reason textarea
- ✅ Cancel and Confirm buttons
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Responsive design

**Handler Functions:**
```typescript
const handleArchiveJob = (action: "complete" | "cancel") => {
  setArchiveAction(action);
  setShowArchiveModal(true);
};

const confirmArchive = async () => {
  setArchiving(true);
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/jobs/${jobId}/archive`, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify({ action: archiveAction, reason: archiveReason }),
    });
    
    if (response.ok) {
      await fetchJob(); // Refresh job data
      setShowArchiveModal(false);
      setArchiveAction(null);
      setArchiveReason("");
    }
  } finally {
    setArchiving(false);
  }
};
```

### 5. Main Jobs List Integration
**File:** `src/app/jobs/page.tsx` (UPDATED)

**Changes:**
1. ✅ Added "View Archive" button to header (gray button with Archive icon)
2. ✅ Filtered out completed/cancelled jobs from main list:

```typescript
const fetchJobs = async () => {
  const data = await response.json();
  const activeJobs = data.filter(
    (job: Job) => job.status !== "COMPLETED" && job.status !== "CANCELLED"
  );
  setJobs(activeJobs);
};
```

**Header Layout:**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Jobs                [Archive] [+Create] │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Technical Details

### Database Schema
**Job Model:**
```prisma
model Job {
  id           String    @id @default(cuid())
  status       JobStatus // Includes COMPLETED and CANCELLED
  completedAt  DateTime?
  // ... other fields
}

enum JobStatus {
  PENDING
  IN_PROGRESS
  ON_HOLD
  AWAITING_APPROVAL
  COMPLETED
  CANCELLED
}
```

**StatusUpdate Model:**
```prisma
model StatusUpdate {
  action      StatusAction // Includes JOB_COMPLETED, JOB_CANCELLED
  // ... other fields
}

enum StatusAction {
  JOB_CREATED
  STATUS_CHANGED
  PRIORITY_CHANGED
  JOB_COMPLETED
  JOB_CANCELLED
  COMMENT_ADDED
  STAFF_ASSIGNED
  COMPLETION_REQUESTED
}
```

### Notification System
When a job is archived, notifications are sent to:
1. ✅ Job Manager (if exists and not the current user)
2. ✅ Job Supervisor (if exists and not the current user)
3. ✅ Assigned Staff (if not the current user)
4. ✅ Job Creator (if different from all above)

**Notification Content:**
```typescript
{
  type: "JOB_COMPLETED" | "JOB_CANCELLED",
  title: "Job Completed" | "Job Cancelled",
  message: `Job ${job.jobId} has been ${action}d by ${userName}`
}
```

### Timeline Entries
Created automatically with details:
```typescript
{
  action: "JOB_COMPLETED" | "JOB_CANCELLED",
  timestamp: new Date(),
  userId: currentUser.id,
  jobId: job.id,
  oldValue: null,
  newValue: action === "complete" ? "COMPLETED" : "CANCELLED"
}
```

### Comments
If reason provided, creates a comment:
```typescript
{
  content: reason,
  userId: currentUser.id,
  jobId: job.id,
  isSystemComment: false
}
```

## UI/UX Highlights
