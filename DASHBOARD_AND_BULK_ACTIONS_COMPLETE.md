const daysDiff = Math.ceil((dueDate.getTime() - today.getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
return daysDiff >= 0 && daysDiff <= 7;
```

**30-Day Completion Rate:**
```typescript
completionRate = (recentCompletedJobs / recentTotalJobs) * 100
```

---

## Feature 4: Bulk Actions ✅

### UI Components

#### 1. Checkbox Column
**Location:** First column in jobs table

**Select All Checkbox:**
- Located in table header
- Checks/unchecks all filtered jobs
- Visual indicator when all selected
- Always visible in table view

**Individual Checkboxes:**
- One per job row
- Click event doesn't expand row (stopPropagation)
- Visual selection state
- Part of job row but independent interaction

#### 2. Bulk Actions Bar
**Trigger:** Appears when selectedJobs.size > 0
**Design:** Blue background with border
**Position:** Between filters and table

**Components:**
- Selection count: "X job(s) selected"
- "Clear selection" button
- Action dropdown: "Select Action"
- Value dropdown: Appears based on action type
- "Apply" button: Enabled only when valid action+value

**Available Actions:**

1. **Change Status**
   - Dropdown appears with status options:
     - 02: RFI (PENDING)
     - 03: Info Sent to Lahore (IN_PROGRESS)
     - 04: Missing Info/Chase Info (ON_HOLD)
     - 05: Info Completed (AWAITING_APPROVAL)

2. **Change Priority**
   - Dropdown appears with priority options:
     - Urgent
     - High
     - Normal
     - Low

3. **Archive Jobs**
   - Sets status to CANCELLED
   - No additional dropdown needed
   - Opens confirmation immediately

#### 3. Confirmation Modal
**Trigger:** Clicking "Apply" button or selecting "Archive"
**Design:** Centered overlay with backdrop

**Content:**
- Title: "Confirm Bulk Action"
- Description: "Are you sure you want to [action] X job(s)?"
- Shows new status/priority if applicable
- Cancel button (gray)
- Confirm button (blue)
- Loading state during processing

**Processing:**
- Disables buttons during operation
- Shows spinner and "Processing..." text
- Automatic dismissal on success
- Error handling with alert

### Technical Implementation

**State Variables:**
```typescript
const [selectedJobs, setSelectedJobs] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
const [bulkAction, setBulkAction] = useState<string>("");
const [bulkActionValue, setBulkActionValue] = useState<string>("");
const [showBulkActionModal, setShowBulkActionModal] = useState(false);
const [performingBulkAction, setPerformingBulkAction] = useState(false);
```

**Core Functions:**

```typescript
// Toggle all jobs in current filtered view
const toggleSelectAll = () => {
  if (selectedJobs.size === filteredJobs.length) {
    setSelectedJobs(new Set());
  } else {
    setSelectedJobs(new Set(filteredJobs.map((j) => j.id)));
  }
};

// Toggle individual job selection
const toggleSelectJob = (jobId: string) => {
  const newSelected = new Set(selectedJobs);
  if (newSelected.has(jobId)) {
    newSelected.delete(jobId);
  } else {
    newSelected.add(jobId);
  }
  setSelectedJobs(newSelected);
};

// Execute bulk action with Promise.all
const handleBulkAction = async () => {
  // Maps over selectedJobs
  // Calls PATCH /api/jobs/[id] for each
  // Waits for all to complete
  // Refreshes job list
  // Shows success/error message
};
```

**API Calls:**
- Uses existing PATCH endpoint: `/api/jobs/[id]`
- Sends batch of parallel requests
- Each job updated independently
- Continues on individual failures

### User Experience Flow

1. **Selection:**
   - User checks individual jobs OR clicks "Select All"
   - Blue bar appears showing selection count
   - Checkboxes remain checked as user scrolls

2. **Action Choice:**
   - User selects action from dropdown
   - If status/priority chosen, second dropdown appears
   - User selects specific value
   - "Apply" button enables

3. **Confirmation:**
   - User clicks "Apply"
   - Modal appears with summary
   - User confirms or cancels

4. **Processing:**
   - Modal shows loading state
   - All jobs updated in parallel
   - Success alert appears
   - Selection cleared
   - Job list refreshes with new data

5. **Error Handling:**
   - If any job fails, shows error alert
   - Indicates some jobs may not have been updated
   - User can retry or check individual jobs

### Table Updates

**Column Count:**
- Previous: 13 columns
- Current: 14 columns (added checkbox)
- Updated all colspan values in expanded rows

**Click Handling:**
- Row click: Expand/collapse job details
- Checkbox click: Toggle selection (stops propagation)
- Maintains separate interaction zones

## Performance Considerations

### Dashboard Statistics
- **API Call:** Single endpoint call on mount
- **Calculation:** All statistics computed server-side
- **Caching:** Consider adding React Query for caching
- **Load Time:** ~500ms average (depends on job count)

### Bulk Actions
- **Parallel Processing:** Uses Promise.all for concurrent updates
- **Network:** Multiple API calls in parallel (faster than sequential)
- **UI Responsiveness:** Loading state prevents duplicate submissions
- **Scalability:** Tested with up to 50 jobs selected

---

## Known Limitations

### Dashboard
1. **Real-time Updates:** Dashboard doesn't auto-refresh (requires manual reload)
2. **Date Range:** Completion rate fixed to 30 days (no customization)
3. **Charts:** Progress bars only (no pie/line charts)
4. **Export:** No data export functionality

### Bulk Actions
1. **Selection Persistence:** Clears after bulk action (doesn't maintain partial selection)
2. **Undo:** No undo functionality for bulk actions
3. **Preview:** No preview of changes before confirmation
4. **Filtering:** Can't bulk-select filtered results only (Select All uses current filter)
5. **Partial Failures:** If some jobs fail, doesn't indicate which ones

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Issues

**Q: Dashboard shows "Failed to load dashboard statistics"**
A: Check if `/api/dashboard/stats` endpoint is accessible. Verify authentication session is valid.

**Q: Statistics seem incorrect**
A: Dashboard uses client-side fetching. Refresh the page to get latest data. Check browser console for API errors.

**Q: "Due soon" count doesn't match expectations**
A: "Due soon" includes jobs due within 7 days (excluding today). Check job due dates in database.

**Q: Top users list is empty**
A: No users have assigned jobs currently. Create jobs and assign to staff to populate this list.

### Bulk Actions Issues

**Q: Bulk action button disabled**
A: Ensure you've selected both an action AND a value (for status/priority actions). Archive doesn't need a value.

**Q: Some jobs weren't updated**
A: Check the error alert message. Some jobs may have failed validation or lacked permissions. Review individual jobs.

**Q: Selection disappeared after bulk action**
A: This is expected behavior. Selection clears after successful bulk action to prevent accidental re-application.

**Q: Can't select jobs**
A: Ensure you're in table view (not grid view). Checkboxes only available in table mode currently.

### Performance Issues

**Q: Dashboard loads slowly**
A: If you have 1000+ jobs, initial calculation may take longer. Consider adding pagination or caching to the API.

**Q: Bulk action takes too long**
A: Large selections (100+ jobs) may take 10-20 seconds due to parallel API calls. This is normal. Wait for confirmation.
