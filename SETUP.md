# Quick Start Guide

## ✅ Project Setup Complete!

Your Job Tracking App has been successfully scaffolded and is now running at:
**http://localhost:3000**

## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. Set Up Your Database

Before you can use authentication and store data, you need to:

1. **Install PostgreSQL** (if not already installed)
   - Download from: https://www.postgresql.org/download/

2. **Create a Database**
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE job_tracking_db;
   ```

3. **Update Environment Variables**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Update `DATABASE_URL` with your PostgreSQL credentials:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/job_tracking_db?schema=public"
   ```

4. **Run Database Migration**
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   ```

5. **Generate a NextAuth Secret**
   ```bash
   # In PowerShell, run:
   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"
   ```
   Copy the output to `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` in your `.env` file

### 2. Build the Authentication System

Next, you'll want to create:
- `/src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` - NextAuth configuration
- `/src/app/auth/login/page.tsx` - Login page
- `/src/app/auth/register/page.tsx` - Registration page
- Middleware for protecting routes

### 3. Create Core Features

The foundation is ready! Now build:
- Dashboard pages for each role
- Job creation and management forms
- Job detail page with timeline and comments
- User management (Admin)
- Department management
- Notification system

### 4. Test with Seed Data

Create a seed script to populate test data:
- Sample users with different roles
- Departments
- Jobs at various stages
- Comments and status updates

## 📚 Important Files

- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Root layout
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Landing page
- `src/lib/prisma.ts` - Prisma client
- `src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `.env` - Environment variables (create from `.env.example`)

## 🛠️ Available Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start dev server (already running!)
npm run build        # Build for production
npm start           # Start production server

# Database
npx prisma studio   # Open database GUI
npx prisma migrate dev  # Run migrations
npx prisma generate # Generate Prisma Client

# Code Quality
npm run lint        # Run linter
```

## 🎨 UI Components

The project is set up to use shadcn/ui components. When you need a component:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add button
npx shadcn-ui@latest add card
npx shadcn-ui@latest add form
# etc.
```

## 📖 Documentation

- Full feature list: See `README.md`
- Database schema: See `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Type definitions: See `src/types/`

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### CSS Errors in VS Code
The `@tailwind` errors are normal - they'll work fine at runtime.

### Module Not Found
If you see module errors, try:
```bash
npm install
npx prisma generate
```

### Database Connection
Make sure PostgreSQL is running and your `.env` file has the correct credentials.

## 🚀 What's Already Built

✅ Next.js 14 with App Router  
✅ TypeScript configuration  
✅ Tailwind CSS with dark mode  
✅ Prisma ORM with complete schema  
✅ Authentication types  
✅ Utility functions  
✅ Landing page  
✅ Project structure  

## 💡 Recommended Next Task

**Set up the database and create the authentication system!**

This will allow you to:
1. Register users
2. Log in
3. Test role-based access control
4. Start building the dashboard
