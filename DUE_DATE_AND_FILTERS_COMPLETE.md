# Due Date Management & Advanced Filters - Complete ✅

## Completion Date
**Date:** January 2025

## Features Implemented

### 1. Due Date Management ✅

#### Job Creation Form (`/jobs/new`)
- ✅ Added `dueDate` field to form (required)
- ✅ Date input with minimum date validation (cannot select past dates)
- ✅ Clean integration with existing form layout
- ✅ Proper TypeScript typing

#### API Integration (`/api/jobs`)
- ✅ Updated POST endpoint to accept `dueDate`
- ✅ Automatic conversion from string to Date object
- ✅ Stored in PostgreSQL database via Prisma

#### Display Features
- ✅ **Table View:** New "Due Date" column after "Job Started"
- ✅ **Grid View:** Due date card with calendar icon
- ✅ **Color Coding:**
  - Red text for overdue jobs (with days overdue counter)
  - Orange text for jobs due within 7 days (with days remaining)
  - Normal text for jobs due later
- ✅ "No due date" placeholder for jobs without due dates

### 2. Advanced Search & Filters ✅

#### New Filter Controls
1. **Department Filter**
   - Dropdown populated from database departments
   - "All Departments" option
   - Icon: Building2

2. **Date Range Filter**
   - Options: All Dates, Due Today, Due This Week, Due This Month, Overdue
   - Smart date calculations
   - Icon: Calendar

3. **Overdue Toggle**
   - Checkbox to show only overdue jobs
   - Filters out completed jobs from overdue check
   - Icon: AlertCircle

#### Filter Logic
- ✅ **8 Simultaneous Filters:**
  1. Search term (Job ID, title, client, staff names)
  2. Service type
  3. Priority
  4. Status
  5. User (role-based filtering)
  6. Department
  7. Date range
  8. Overdue toggle

- ✅ **Smart Overdue Detection:**
  - Checks: `dueDate < today AND status !== COMPLETED`
  - Completed jobs never show as overdue

- ✅ **Date Range Categories:**
  - TODAY: Due today (daysDiff === 0)
  - THIS_WEEK: Due in next 7 days
  - THIS_MONTH: Due in next 30 days
  - OVERDUE: Due date has passed

#### UI/UX Improvements
- ✅ Responsive 4-column filter grid (was 5-column)
- ✅ "Clear all filters" button resets all 8 filters
- ✅ Filter count shown in header (X of Y jobs)
- ✅ Consistent styling with existing filters

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/app/jobs/new/page.tsx`
```typescript
// Added dueDate to formData state
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
  // ... other fields
  dueDate: "",
});

// Added due date input field
<input
  type="date"
  name="dueDate"
  value={formData.dueDate}
  onChange={handleChange}
  min={new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]}
  required
/>
```

### 2. `/src/app/api/jobs/route.ts`
```typescript
// Updated POST endpoint to handle dueDate
const {
  // ... other fields
  dueDate,
} = await req.json();

// Store in database with Date conversion
await prisma.job.create({
  data: {
    // ... other fields
    dueDate: dueDate ? new Date(dueDate) : undefined,
  },
});
```

### 3. `/src/app/jobs/page.tsx`
**Added State:**
- `departmentFilter` (string, default "ALL")
- `dateRangeFilter` (string, default "ALL")
- `overdueFilter` (boolean, default false)
- `departments` (Department[], fetched from API)

**Enhanced Filter Logic:**
```typescript
// Department matching
const matchesDepartment = 
  departmentFilter === "ALL" || job.department?.id === departmentFilter;

// Overdue detection
const isOverdue = 
  job.dueDate && new Date(job.dueDate) < new Date() && job.status !== "COMPLETED";
const matchesOverdue = !overdueFilter || isOverdue;

// Date range matching with smart calculations
const matchesDateRange = dateRangeFilter === "ALL" || (() => {
  // Calculate days difference and categorize
})();
```

**UI Components:**
- Department filter dropdown
- Date range filter dropdown  
- Overdue checkbox toggle
- Due date column in table view
- Due date card in grid view

### 4. Added Icons
- `Calendar` from lucide-react (due date indicator)
- `AlertCircle` from lucide-react (overdue warning)

## Technical Details

### Database Schema (No Changes Needed)
The `Job` model already has the `dueDate` field from earlier schema updates:
```prisma
model Job {
  // ... other fields
  dueDate    DateTime?
}
```

### Date Calculations
```typescript
// Calculate days until due date
const daysDiff = Math.ceil(
  (dueDate.getTime() - today.getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)
);

// Categorize
if (daysDiff < 0) return "OVERDUE";
if (daysDiff === 0) return "TODAY";
if (daysDiff <= 7) return "THIS_WEEK";
if (daysDiff <= 30) return "THIS_MONTH";
```

### Filter Priority
Filters are applied in order:
1. Search term (text matching)
2. Service type (exact match)
3. Priority (exact match)
4. Status (exact match)
5. User (role-based logic)
6. Department (exact match)
7. Overdue (boolean check)
8. Date range (calculated category)

All must match for a job to appear in results.

## User Experience

### Creating Jobs
1. User fills out job form
2. Must select a due date (required field)
3. Cannot select past dates (validation)
4. Date automatically formatted for database

### Viewing Jobs
1. Due dates visible in both table and grid views
2. Overdue jobs highlighted in red with counter
3. Upcoming jobs (within 7 days) shown in orange
4. Color-coded visual hierarchy for urgency

### Filtering Jobs
1. Use department dropdown to filter by department
2. Use date range dropdown for time-based views
3. Check "Overdue Jobs" to see only overdue items
4. Combine with other filters for precise results
5. Click "Clear all filters" to reset everything

## Performance Notes

### Filter Optimization
- Client-side filtering for instant response
- Single pass through jobs array
- Early return on failed matches
- No redundant calculations

### Date Calculations
- Dates parsed once per job
- Results cached in closure
- No repeated API calls

### Department Loading
- Fetched once on component mount
- Cached in state for filter dropdown
- No refetch on filter change

## Known Limitations

1. **Static Date Ranges:** Date ranges are fixed (7 days, 30 days). Future enhancement could add custom date range picker.

2. **Time Zone:** Dates compared using client's local time zone. Consider server-side UTC for global teams.

3. **No Date Sorting:** Jobs list not sorted by due date. Future enhancement could add column sorting.

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 1 (Quick Wins)
- [ ] Sort table by due date column
- [ ] Add "Due This Year" filter option
- [ ] Bulk update due dates
- [ ] Due date notifications (email/push)

### Phase 2 (Medium Complexity)
- [ ] Custom date range picker (from/to dates)
- [ ] Due date reminders (3 days before, 1 day before)
- [ ] Recurring due dates for repeated tasks
- [ ] Due date history tracking

### Phase 3 (Advanced)
- [ ] Smart due date suggestions (AI/ML based)
- [ ] Calendar view of all due dates
- [ ] Integration with Google Calendar/Outlook
- [ ] Automatic due date extensions with approval workflow

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Due dates not showing?**
A: Check if job has dueDate field. Old jobs may have null due dates.

**Q: Filter not working?**
A: Clear all filters and try again. Check browser console for errors.

**Q: Overdue toggle not working?**
A: Ensure job has a due date and status is not "COMPLETED".

**Q: Department filter empty?**
A: Check if departments exist in database. Run department seed script if needed.

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check if due dates exist in database
npx prisma studio
# Navigate to Job model, check dueDate column

# Verify departments loaded
# Check browser console for: "Fetched X departments"

# Test date calculations
# Open browser DevTools, check date-related logs
```
