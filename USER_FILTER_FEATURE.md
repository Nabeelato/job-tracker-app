## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **Filter Logic:**
```javascript
// When filtering by user:
if (user.role === "STAFF")
  → Show jobs where assignedTo.id === userId

if (user.role === "SUPERVISOR")  
  → Show jobs where supervisor.id === userId

if (user.role === "MANAGER")
  → Show jobs where manager.id === userId

if (user.role === "ADMIN")
  → Show jobs where manager.id OR supervisor.id OR assignedTo.id === userId
```

### **Database Schema:**
- ✅ Jobs already have `manager.id`, `supervisor.id`, `assignedTo.id`
- ✅ No schema changes needed
- ✅ Uses existing relationships

---

## 📝 **Usage Examples**

### **For Managers:**
```
"I need to check Hashir's workload"
→ Jobs page → Filter by User → Select "Hashir"
→ See all jobs he's supervising
```

### **For Team Planning:**
```
"Who has the most jobs?"
→ Click each team member name in table
→ Count shows: "Sara: 8 jobs, Ali: 5 jobs"
→ Decide who gets next job
```

### **For Staff:**
```
"What are my active jobs?"
→ Jobs page → Filter by User → "🔵 My Jobs"
→ See only your assigned jobs
```
