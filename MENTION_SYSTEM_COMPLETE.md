# Enhanced @Mention System - Complete ✅

## Problem
The @mention feature wasn't working properly:
- Users typing `@Admin` in comments didn't create proper mentions
- No autocomplete or suggestions
- No notifications sent to mentioned users
- Mentions not visually highlighted in comments

## Solution
Built a comprehensive @mention system with autocomplete and proper formatting.

---

## New Components

### 1. CommentInput Component
**File:** `/src/components/comment-input.tsx`

**Features:**
- **Autocomplete Dropdown**
  - Appears when user types `@`
  - Shows all users filtered by name, email, or role
  - Real-time search as user types
  - Click to insert mention

- **Mention Format**
  - Uses format: `@[UserName](userId)`
  - Example: `@[John Doe](abc123)`
  - This format is recognized by the backend API

- **Visual Preview**
  - Shows how mentions will look before posting
  - Highlights mentions in blue
  - @AtSign icon indicator

- **Keyboard Shortcuts**
  - `Ctrl+Enter` or `Cmd+Enter` to submit
  - `Escape` to close autocomplete
  - Arrow keys to navigate (future enhancement)

- **User Experience**
  - Character count display
  - Helpful tips shown below input
  - Loading state while posting
  - Disabled state during submission
  - Auto-focus after mention insertion

### 2. CommentsList Component
**File:** `/src/components/comments-list.tsx`

**Features:**
- **Mention Rendering**
  - Parses `@[Name](userId)` format
  - Converts to visual badges
  - Gray background for regular mentions
  - Blue background with ring for current user mentions

- **User Mentions Highlighting**
  - If current user is mentioned, shows:
    - Blue ring around comment card
    - "You were mentioned" badge
    - Prominent visual attention

- **Rich Comment Display**
  - User avatar with gradient colors
  - User name and role badge
  - Relative timestamps ("2 minutes ago")
  - Whitespace preserved in text
  - Word wrapping for long content

- **Empty State**
  - Shows message when no comments
  - Icon and encouraging text
  - Prompts user to be first to comment

---

## How It Works

### User Flow

1. **User starts typing comment**
   - Clicks in comment textarea
   - Types their message

2. **User wants to mention someone**
   - Types `@` character
   - Autocomplete dropdown appears instantly

3. **User searches for person**
   - Types part of name: `@joh`
   - List filters to matching users
   - Shows "John Doe", "Johnny Smith", etc.

4. **User selects person**
   - Clicks on user in dropdown
   - OR presses Enter when highlighted
   - Mention inserted: `@[John Doe](user-id-123)`

5. **User sees preview**
   - Preview box shows formatted comment
   - Mentions highlighted in blue
   - User can continue typing

6. **User submits comment**
   - Clicks "Post Comment" button
   - OR presses `Ctrl+Enter`
   - Comment posted with mentions

7. **Mentioned user gets notified**
   - Backend extracts mentions from `@[Name](userId)` format
   - Creates notifications for each mentioned user
   - Notification appears in bell icon
   - Email sent (if configured)

---

## Technical Implementation

### Mention Detection
```typescript
// In CommentInput component
const textBeforeCursor = value.substring(0, curPos);
const lastAtIndex = textBeforeCursor.lastIndexOf("@");

if (lastAtIndex !== -1) {
  const textAfterAt = textBeforeCursor.substring(lastAtIndex + 1);
  if (!textAfterAt.includes(" ") && !textAfterAt.includes("\n")) {
    setMentionStartPos(lastAtIndex);
    setMentionSearch(textAfterAt.toLowerCase());
    setShowMentionDropdown(true);
  }
}
```

### Mention Insertion
```typescript
const insertMention = (user: User) => {
  const beforeMention = comment.substring(0, mentionStartPos);
  const afterMention = comment.substring(cursorPosition);
  const mentionText = `@[${user.name}](${user.id})`;
  const newComment = beforeMention + mentionText + " " + afterMention;
  setComment(newComment);
};
```

### Mention Rendering
```typescript
// In CommentsList component
const mentionRegex = /@\[([^\]]+)\]\(([^)]+)\)/g;
let match;

while ((match = mentionRegex.exec(content)) !== null) {
  // match[1] = User name
  // match[2] = User ID
  // Render as styled badge
}
```

### Backend Processing
```typescript
// In /api/jobs/[id]/comments/route.ts
import { extractMentions, createNotification } from "@/lib/notifications"

// Extract mentions
const mentions = extractMentions(content);  // Returns array of user IDs

// Create comment with mentions
const comment = await prisma.comment.create({
  data: {
    content,
    jobId: params.id,
    userId: dbUser.id,
    mentions: mentions,  // Store mention IDs
  },
});

// Notify mentioned users
for (const mentionedUserId of mentions) {
  if (mentionedUserId !== dbUser.id) {
    await createNotification({
      userId: mentionedUserId,
      type: "COMMENT_MENTION",
      title: "You were mentioned in a comment",
      content: `${dbUser.name} mentioned you...`,
      jobId: params.id,
      commentId: comment.id,
      actionUrl: `/jobs/${params.id}`,
    });
  }
}
```

3. **Mention Validation**: Doesn't validate if mentioned user has access to job

4. **Mobile Keyboard**: @ trigger might not work perfectly on some mobile keyboards

5. **Performance**: With 1000+ users, dropdown might be slow (add virtualization if needed)

## Troubleshooting

### "Autocomplete doesn't appear"
**Solution:** Make sure you're typing @ in the comment box. Click to focus first.

### "Mention doesn't send notification"
**Solution:** Check that:
1. Mention format is correct: `@[Name](userId)`
2. User ID exists in database
3. Backend API `/api/jobs/[id]/comments` is working
4. Check browser console for errors

### "Mentioned user badge not blue"
**Solution:** Make sure `currentUserId` prop is passed to CommentsList component with correct session user ID.

### "Dropdown shows no users"
**Solution:** Check that:
1. `/api/users` endpoint returns user list
2. Users have valid names and emails
3. Network tab shows successful response

### "Can't type after inserting mention"
**Solution:** This is a bug. Check that textarea ref and cursor position are set correctly. Refresh page if needed.

---

## API Integration

### Frontend to Backend
```typescript
// POST /api/jobs/[jobId]/comments
{
  "content": "Hey @[John Doe](user-123) can you help?"
}
```

### Backend Processing
```typescript
// 1. Extract mentions using regex
const mentions = extractMentions(content);
// Returns: ["user-123"]

// 2. Store comment with mentions
await prisma.comment.create({
  data: {
    content,
    jobId,
    userId,
    mentions,  // Array of user IDs
  },
});

// 3. Create notifications
for (const userId of mentions) {
  await createNotification({
    userId,
    type: "COMMENT_MENTION",
    ...
  });
}
```
