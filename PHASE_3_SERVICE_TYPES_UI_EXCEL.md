# Phase 3 Complete: Service Type UI + Excel Export Reports ✅

## Summary

Successfully implemented **Phase 3** with TWO major features:
1. **Service Type UI** - Visual service type selection in job creation
2. **User Completion Reports** - Excel-exportable completion tracking for all users

## Feature 1: Service Type UI in Job Creation

### What Was Implemented

#### 1. Job Creation Form Enhanced (`/jobs/new`)

**Service Type Checkboxes Added:**
- 📋 **Bookkeeping** (Blue) - Calculator icon
- 💰 **VAT** (Green) - FileText icon  
- ✅ **Audit** (Purple) - CheckCircle icon
- 📊 **Financial Statements** (Orange) - FileSpreadsheet icon

**Features:**
- Interactive checkbox cards with hover effects
- Color-coded borders when selected
- Icons for visual identification
- Validation: At least one service type required
- Submit button disabled until service type selected
- Grid layout (2 columns on desktop, 1 on mobile)

**Code Implementation:**
```typescript
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
  jobId: "",
  clientName: "",
  title: "",
  supervisorId: "",
  startedAt: "",
  priority: "NORMAL",
  serviceTypes: [] as string[],  // NEW
});

const toggleServiceType = (serviceType: string) => {
  setFormData(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    serviceTypes: prev.serviceTypes.includes(serviceType)
      ? prev.serviceTypes.filter(st => st !== serviceType)
      : [...prev.serviceTypes, serviceType]
  }));
};
```

**UI Design:**
- Checkbox cards with 2px borders
- Hover state changes background color
- Selected state: colored border + background
- Icon + label layout
- Responsive grid

#### 2. API Enhanced for Service Types

**Jobs API POST (`/api/jobs`):**
```typescript
// Extract serviceTypes from request
const { jobId, clientName, title, supervisorId, serviceTypes } = body;

// Validate service types
if (!serviceTypes || serviceTypes.length === 0) {
  missingFields.push("Service Types");
}

// Create job with service types
const job = await prisma.job.create({
  data: {
    // ... other fields
    serviceTypes: serviceTypes || [],
  },
});
```

## Feature 2: User Completion Reports with Excel Export

### What Was Implemented

    "Priority", "Department", "Assigned By",
    "Created Date", "Due Date", "Completed Date",
    "Days to Complete"
  ];

  const rows = filteredJobs.map((job) => {
    const daysToComplete = Math.ceil(
      (completedDate - createdDate) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)
    );
    return [/* ... all fields ... */];
  });

  // Create CSV and download
  const blob = new Blob([csvContent], { type: "text/csv" });
  // ... download logic
};
```

#### 2. API Endpoint Created (`/api/users/[id]/completed-jobs`)

**Fetches Completed Jobs:**
```typescript
const completedJobs = await prisma.job.findMany({
  where: {
    OR: [
      { assignedToId: userId },
      { managerId: userId },
      { supervisorId: userId },
    ],
    status: "COMPLETED",
  },
  include: {
    assignedBy: { select: { name: true } },
    department: { select: { name: true } },
  },
  orderBy: { completedAt: "desc" },
});
```

**Features:**
