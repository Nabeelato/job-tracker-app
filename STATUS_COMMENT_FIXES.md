# Status Update & Comment Display Fixes

## ✅ Fixed Issues:

### 1. **Status Updates Not Working** - FIXED!

**Problem:**
- Status updates were failing with foreign key constraint error
- `session.user.id` was not a valid database user ID

**Solution:**
- Updated PATCH endpoint in `/api/jobs/[id]/route.ts`
- Now fetches actual database user by email first
- Uses `dbUser.id` for all status update operations
- Changed action from "Status changed" to "STATUS_CHANGED" for consistency

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Before (BROKEN):
userId: session.user.id

// After (FIXED):
const dbUser = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: { email: session.user.email }
})
userId: dbUser.id
```

### 2. **Comments More Prominent** - ENHANCED!

**Problem:**
- Comments appeared as simple text: "Admin added a comment"
- Hard to distinguish from other timeline events
- Comment content was hidden or de-emphasized

**Solution:**
- Redesigned comment display in timeline
- Comments now have:
  - **Blue accent color** for commenter name
  - **"commented:" label** instead of "added a comment"
  - **Blue-tinted background box** for the comment content
  - **Left border accent** (blue stripe on left)
  - **Larger, more readable text**
  - **Pre-wrap formatting** to preserve line breaks

**Visual Difference:**

**Before:**
```
💬 Admin Smith added a comment
   This is my comment text
   2 hours ago
```

**After:**
```
💬 Admin Smith commented:
   ┃ This is my comment text
   ┃ (in a blue-highlighted box with left border)
   2 hours ago
```
