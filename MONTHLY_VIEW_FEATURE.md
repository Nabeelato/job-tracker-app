**Monthly View Display:**
```

│ 15 jobs                             │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Job Table (when expanded)          │
│  - All existing table features      │
│  - Checkboxes, filters, timeline    │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📅 September 2025           ▼       │
│ 23 jobs                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **Archive Page**

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Files Created:**
1. **`src/components/monthly-jobs-view.tsx`**
   - Reusable component for monthly job display
   - Handles job grouping, expansion, timeline
   - Supports checkboxes and user filtering

### **Files Modified:**
1. **`src/lib/date-utils.ts`**
   - Added `groupByMonth()` - Groups items by creation month
   - Added `getMonthKey()` - Creates "YYYY-MM" format keys
   - Added `getMonthLabel()` - Formats month labels ("October 2025")
   - Added `getMonthLabelFromKey()` - Converts keys to labels
   - Added `getAvailableMonths()` - Lists all months with job counts

2. **`src/app/jobs/page.tsx`**
   - Added `viewMode` state with "monthly" option
   - Added `monthFilter` state
   - Added Monthly view button (List icon)
   - Added month filter dropdown

   - Added month grouping for archived jobs
   - Added view mode toggle
   - Added month filter dropdown

---

## 🎨 **How It Works**

### **Grouping Logic:**
```typescript
// Jobs are grouped by their CREATION DATE
const jobsByMonth = groupByMonth(jobs, 'createdAt');

// Creates structure like:
{
  "2025-10": [job1, job2, job3],  // October 2025
  "2025-09": [job4, job5],         // September 2025
  "2025-08": [job6, job7, job8]    // August 2025
}
```

### **Month Key Format:**
- `"2025-10"` → "October 2025"
- `"2025-09"` → "September 2025"
- Months sorted newest first

### **Filter Integration:**
- Month filter works WITH all existing filters
- Can combine: "September 2025" + "High Priority" + "Assigned to John"
- "Clear all filters" button resets month filter too

## 📊 **Benefits**

### **For Users:**

✅ **Better Organization** - Find jobs by when they were created  
✅ **Faster Navigation** - Collapse months you don't need to see

✅ **Improved Performance** - Only renders visible months

### **For Managers:**
