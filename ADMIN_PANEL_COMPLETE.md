---

## Database Schema

No schema changes needed - uses existing User model:

```prisma
model User {
  id            String    @id @default(cuid())
  name          String
  email         String    @unique
  password      String    // Hashed with bcrypt
  role          UserRole  @default(STAFF)
  departmentId  String?
  isActive      Boolean   @default(true)
  avatar        String?
  createdAt     DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt     DateTime  @updatedAt
  
  // Relations...
}

enum UserRole {
  ADMIN
  MANAGER
  SUPERVISOR
  STAFF
}
```

---

## Technical Implementation

### State Management:
```typescript
const [users, setUsers] = useState<User[]>([]);
const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState("");
const [roleFilter, setRoleFilter] = useState("ALL");
const [showCreateModal, setShowCreateModal] = useState(false);
const [editingUser, setEditingUser] = useState<User | null>(null);
const [deletingUserId, setDeletingUserId] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({ ... });
const [formLoading, setFormLoading] = useState(false);
```

### Filtering Logic:
```typescript
const filteredUsers = users.filter((user) => {
  const matchesSearch =
    user.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase()) ||
    user.email.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase());
  const matchesRole = roleFilter === "ALL" || user.role === roleFilter;
  return matchesSearch && matchesRole;
});
```

### Form Handling:
```typescript
// Create
const handleCreateUser = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  const response = await fetch("/api/auth/register", {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify(formData),
  });
  // Handle response...
};

// Update
const handleUpdateUser = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${editingUser.id}`, {
    method: "PATCH",
    body: JSON.stringify(updateData),
  });
  // Handle response...
};

// Delete
const handleDeleteUser = async (userId: string) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`, {
    method: "DELETE",
  });
  // Handle response...
};
```
