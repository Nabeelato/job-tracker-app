# Department Management System - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive department management system to support the organization's 3-department structure with cross-department collaboration capabilities.

## Real-World Context

   - Manages VAT bookkeeping
   - Handles Audit and Financial Statement bookkeeping
   - Service types: Bookkeeping, VAT

2. **Audit Department**
   - Handles bookkeeping and auditing tasks
   - Sometimes interacts with BookKeeping department
   - Service types: Bookkeeping, Audit, Financial Statements

3. **VAT/TAX Department**
   - Manages VAT services and bookkeeping
   - Refers bookkeeping work to BookKeeping department
   - Service types: VAT, Bookkeeping

## What Was Implemented

  name: string;
  managerId: string | null;
  manager: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    email: string;
    role: string;
  } | null;
  _count: {
    users: number;  // Number of team members
    jobs: number;   // Number of jobs assigned
  };
}
```

**Features:**

- Shows user count per department
- Shows active job count per department
- Ordered alphabetically by department name

#### POST Request
```typescript
// Create new department (Admin only)
{
  name: string;          // Required
  managerId?: string;    // Optional - must be MANAGER or ADMIN role
}
```

**Features:**

### 3. Admin Panel Integration

  name      String   @unique
  managerId String?  @unique
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

  manager User?  @relation("DepartmentManager", fields: [managerId], references: [id])
  users   User[] @relation("DepartmentUsers")

}
```

**Relationships:**

## Technical Implementation Details

### API Security
```typescript
// Admin-only check
const session = await getServerSession(authOptions);
if (!session || session.user.role !== "ADMIN") {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: "Unauthorized" }, { status: 401 });
}
```

### Manager Validation
```typescript
// Verify manager exists and has appropriate role
const manager = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: { id: managerId },
});

if (!manager || (manager.role !== "MANAGER" && manager.role !== "ADMIN")) {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: "Invalid manager. Must be a Manager or Admin." },
    { status: 400 }
  );
}
```

### Data Fetching with Relations
```typescript
// Get departments with full details
const departments = await prisma.department.findMany({
  include: {
    manager: {
      select: {
        id: true,
        name: true,
        email: true,
        role: true,
      },
    },
    _count: {
      select: {
        users: true,
        jobs: true,
      },
    },
  },
  orderBy: {
    name: "asc",
  },
});
```
