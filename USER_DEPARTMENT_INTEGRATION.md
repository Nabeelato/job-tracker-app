# User-Department Integration - Phase 1 Complete ✅

## Overview
Successfully integrated department assignment into the user management system. Users can now be assigned to departments when created or edited, and their department is displayed throughout the admin interface.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Admin Panel Updates (`/admin`)

#### Enhanced User Interface
✅ **Department Column in Users Table**
- New "Department" column between "Role" and "Status"
- Shows department name with building icon
- "Not assigned" state for users without department
- Visual indicator using Building2 icon

✅ **Department Assignment in Forms**
- Department dropdown added to both Create and Edit user modals
- Dropdown populated with all available departments
- "No Department" option for unassigned users
- Department selection persists when editing users

#### Updated State Management
```typescript
// Added departments state
const [departments, setDepartments] = useState<Department[]>([]);

// Added departmentId to form state
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
  name: "",
  email: "",
  password: "",
  role: "STAFF",
  isActive: true,
  departmentId: "",  // NEW
});
```

#### New Fetch Function
```typescript
const fetchDepartments = async () => {
  const response = await fetch("/api/departments");
  const data = await response.json();
  setDepartments(data);
};
```

### 2. API Updates

#### Registration API (`/api/auth/register`)
**Enhanced POST Request:**
```typescript
// Now accepts departmentId
const { name, email, password, role, isActive, departmentId } = body;

// Creates user with department assignment
const user = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    name,
    email,
    password: hashedPassword,
    role: role || "STAFF",
    isActive: isActive !== undefined ? isActive : true,
    departmentId: departmentId || null,  // NEW
  },
  select: {
    // ... other fields
    department: {
      select: {
        id: true,
        name: true,
      }
    }
  }
});
```

**Features:**
- Accepts optional `departmentId` in request body
- Sets to null if not provided
- Returns department info in response

#### Users API (`/api/users/[id]`)
**Enhanced PATCH Request:**
```typescript
// Now accepts departmentId
const { name, email, password, role, isActive, departmentId } = body;

// Build update data with department
if (departmentId !== undefined) {
  updateData.departmentId = departmentId || null;
}

// Update user with department included in response
const updatedUser = await prisma.user.update({
  where: { id: params.id },
  data: updateData,
  select: {
    // ... other fields
    department: {
      select: {
        id: true,
        name: true,
      }
    }
  }
});
```

**Features:**
- Updates department assignment
- Handles null value for removing department
- Returns updated department info

#### Users List API (`/api/users`)
**Already Included Department:**
```typescript
// GET /api/users already returns department
const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  select: {
    // ... other fields
    department: {
      select: {
        id: true,
        name: true,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

### 3. Database Schema (Existing)
The database already supports user-department relationship:

```prisma
model User {
  id           String      @id @default(uuid())
  name         String
  email        String      @unique
  password     String
  role         Role        @default(STAFF)
  isActive     Boolean     @default(true)
  departmentId String?
  createdAt    DateTime    @default(now())
  updatedAt    DateTime    @updatedAt

  department   Department? @relation("DepartmentUsers", fields: [departmentId], references: [id])
  // ... other relations
}
```

## User Interface Details

### Admin Users Table
The users table now displays:
1. **User Info** (Avatar, Name, Email)
2. **Role** (Color-coded badge)
3. **Department** (NEW - with building icon)
4. **Status** (Active/Inactive)
5. **Created** (Date)
6. **Actions** (Edit/Delete buttons)

### Create User Modal
Fields included:
1. Name (required)
2. Email (required)
3. Password (required)
4. Role (dropdown: STAFF, SUPERVISOR, MANAGER, ADMIN)
5. **Department (dropdown: All departments + "No Department")** ← NEW
6. Status toggle (Active/Inactive)

### Edit User Modal
Fields included:
1. Name (required)
2. Email (required)
3. Password (optional - leave blank to keep current)
4. Role (dropdown)
5. **Department (dropdown - pre-filled with user's current department)** ← NEW
6. Status toggle

## Workflow Examples

### Assigning User to Department
1. Admin opens Create User modal
2. Fills in user details (name, email, password, role)
3. Selects department from dropdown
4. Clicks "Create User"
5. User is created with department assignment
6. User appears in table with department shown

### Changing User's Department
1. Admin clicks "Edit" on user
2. Edit modal opens with current department selected
3. Admin selects different department (or "No Department")
4. Clicks "Save Changes"
5. User's department is updated
6. Table refreshes showing new department

### Viewing Unassigned Users
- Users without department show "Not assigned" in gray text
- Can be filtered or identified easily
- Can be assigned department through edit modal

## Technical Implementation

### Form State Management
```typescript
// Initialize with empty departmentId
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
  // ... other fields
  departmentId: "",
});

// Populate when editing user
const openEditModal = (user: User) => {
  setEditingUser(user);
  setFormData({
    // ... other fields
    departmentId: user.department?.id || "",  // Use existing or empty
  });
};

// Reset after create/cancel
const resetForm = () => {
  setFormData({
    // ... other fields
    departmentId: "",
  });
};
```

### API Payload Construction
```typescript
// Create user
const payload = {
  ...formData,
  departmentId: formData.departmentId || null,  // Convert empty string to null
};

// Update user
const updateData: any = {
  // ... other fields
  departmentId: formData.departmentId || null,  // Handle undefined/null/empty
};
```

### Department Dropdown Component
```tsx
<div>
  <label className="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-2">
    Department
  </label>
  <select
    value={formData.departmentId}
    onChange={(e) =>
      setFormData({ ...formData, departmentId: e.target.value })
    }
    className="w-full px-3 py-2 border border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-600 rounded-lg focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500 dark:bg-gray-700 dark:text-white"
  >
    <option value="">No Department</option>
    {departments.map((dept) => (
      <option key={dept.id} value={dept.id}>
        {dept.name}
      </option>
    ))}
  </select>
</div>
```

### Department Display Component
```tsx
<td className="px-6 py-4">
  {user.department ? (
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
      <Building2 className="w-4 h-4 text-indigo-600 dark:text-indigo-400" />
      <span className="text-sm text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
        {user.department.name}
      </span>
    </div>
  ) : (
    <span className="text-sm text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-500">
      Not assigned
    </span>
  )}
</td>
```
